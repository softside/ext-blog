This directory contains some shell script to manage an ext-blog on a VPS.
Actually they're only useful for me. Everytime after I changed some features of
 ext-blog, I can upload the whole ext-blog source codes to VPS, and SSH to VPS
to restart the server (or reload the source codes).

In ext-blog root directory:

contrib/upload-dist.sh abc@codemacro.com 21 /home/test

This script will upload the full ext-blog source codes to VPS directory 
/home/test, and it ssh to the VPS. 

And now you're login the VPS, go to /home/test, and:

tar xvf ext-blog.tar.gz 

It will tar source codes in dist/ directory. Go to the directory and start 
ext-blog:

cd dist
contrib/run-blog.sh

This will run ext-blog as a GNU screen session. If the blog already run, you 
can:

./update-blog.sh

This script will attach the ext-blog GNU screen seesion, and in SBCL, you can:

(asdf:load-system :ext-blog)

to reload all source codes.
